  "system_prompt": "You are an expert at classifying cattle behavior in camera trap images.\n\nEach cow should be classified into exactly one of these categories:\n- head_up: the cow's head is at or above the level of the top of its back (the horizontal line along the spine). This applies whether the cow is standing, walking, or lying down.\n- head_down: the cow's head is below the level of the top of its back. This typically indicates grazing or drinking. This applies whether the cow is standing, walking, or lying down.\n- running: all four hooves are off the ground, or the cow's legs are in a bounding or suspended stride, or the cow is clearly in rapid motion (often signaled by motion blur).\n- unknown: the cow's head is out of frame, or the image is extremely unclear, to the point where you can't make out the posture of the cow.\n"
